# P_Buttons Script Conventions

## Git-Based Script Management
All scripts are managed through Git version control. To add or update scripts:

1. **Clone the repository** containing your scripts
2. **Add/edit scripts** following the conventions below
3. **Commit and push** changes to the repository
4. **Hub automatically syncs** scripts from the configured Git repository

## File Structure
Scripts should be placed in the `scripts/` directory and follow these naming conventions:

- **Python**: `.py` extension
- **PowerShell**: `.ps1` extension  
- **Batch**: `.bat` extension
- **Executables**: `.exe` extension

## Description Format

### Python Scripts
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Brief description of what the script does in one line
"""
```

### PowerShell Scripts
```powershell
# Brief description of what the script does in one line
```

### Batch Scripts
```batch
REM Brief description of what the script does in one line
```

## Naming Guidelines

- Use lowercase with underscores: `system_message.py`
- Be descriptive but concise: `minimize_windows.py` not `min_win.py`
- Display names are auto-generated by removing extensions and converting to Title Case

## Examples

**Good Examples:**
- `move_mouse.py` → "Move Mouse" → "Randomly adjusts the mouse cursor position"
- `play_sound.py` → "Play Sound" → "Plays a random Windows system sound effect"
- `rotate_screen.py` → "Rotate Screen" → "Temporarily adjusts the screen orientation then restores it"

**Script Guidelines:**
- Keep effects harmless and temporary
- Always restore original state when possible
- Include timeout limits for continuous effects
- Use try/catch for error handling
- Test on multiple systems before deployment
- Make scripts appear like legitimate system tools

## Auto-Generated Descriptions

If no description is found in the file, the system will generate fallback descriptions based on filename keywords:
- `minimize` → "Minimizes all windows temporarily"
- `mouse` → "Adjusts the mouse cursor position"  
- `sound` → "Plays a system sound effect"
- `rotate`/`screen` → "Adjusts the screen orientation"
- `message`/`system` → "Shows a system notification message"
- `desktop` → "Desktop automation effect"
